# Prim’s Algorithm in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates **Prim’s Algorithm**, a greedy graph algorithm used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, weighted, undirected graph.

Prim’s algorithm grows the MST by starting from a chosen vertex and repeatedly adding the **minimum-weight edge** that connects a vertex inside the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

Steps Prim’s Algorithm follows:

1. Start from an arbitrary vertex.
